##Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver 1.0 for Linux Fixed Install Scripts
======================================================================

These are just some adjusted scripts to work on Debian/Ubuntu servers.
These are tested working on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - and they're supposed to
 work out of the box on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

These scripts are adjusted to pull [unixODBC](http://www.unixodbc.org/)
 version 2.3.2 from the web.
